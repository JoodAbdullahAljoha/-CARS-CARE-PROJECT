# CARS-CARE-PROJECT

The Cars Care program offers a convenient car wash service directly at the user's location, eliminating the need to visit car washes. This service helps save time, effort, and reduces the hassle of road congestion, among many other benefits.

## Service Packages

We provide several subscription packages to cater to different needs:

- **Weekly Package**: Includes regular washes on a weekly basis.
- **Monthly Package**: A monthly subscription with regular washes throughout the month.
- **Annual Package**: A yearly package offering consistent car washes for the entire year.

Each package comes with its own unique advantages, designed to provide the best value and convenience for the user.

## One-Time Service Option

If you are unsure about subscribing to a package, you can try the service with a **one-time wash**. This option allows you to schedule a wash at a time and place that is most convenient for you, without committing to a subscription package.

## How to Use

1. Choose your preferred package or one-time wash service.
2. Set the time and location that work best for you.
3. Enjoy a professional car wash right at your doorstep!
